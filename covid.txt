<h1> COVID-19 </h1>
<div class="para">
<p1>COVID-19 has impacted everyone some way or the other. The most common impact was seen to be on employment and health (both physical and mental). As online schooling and work from home have been introduced in this pandemic, people have been spending more time on laptops which limits their interaction with real people. As governments have been taking decisions to impose full or partial lockdowns to prevent the spread of COVID-19, people feel isolated and distanced from the world. Self-isolation and quarantine can have a lot of negative impact on the mental health. The feeling of being isolated, separated from loved ones cause a lot of mental problems. In addition to this, the cause a lot of physical inactivity. Also, because gyms and pools have closed, people are left with no option to stay fit. The craze of making and eating new dishes during lockdown also increased which further added to weight gain in people. Overall COVID has had a negative impact on FITNESS. </p1>
