<p1>This is a fitness blog called <b> FITHUB</b> where <b>FITNESS </b> is of utmost priority. Here we will talk what fitness actually is, its importance , how diet plays an important role in Fitness and how COVID-19 has had a huge impact on everyone.When it comes to Fitness it's not just about physical but also <em>mental which involves depression, taking too much stress</em>. Only if your mind is stable then only your body achieves what it wants. FITNESS is like a perspective that differs from person to pesron. In this blog, FITNESS is portrayed through my perspective. My only conclusion is that <strong>FITNESS IS NOT ABOUT HAVING A PERFECT BODY</strong> it's all about just having a healthy life and body.
